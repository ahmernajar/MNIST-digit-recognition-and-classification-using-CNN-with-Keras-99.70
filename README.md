#### The training dataset consists of 42000 rows each of 784 pixel values thus representing 28 x 28 sized 42000 images of different digits from 0 to 9 .
#### I have used Convolutional Neural Networks to train the model with the help of Keras and made predictions on the 28000 images of the test dataset, also achieved **99.321 %** valid accuracy with just 10 epochs .
#### Also tuned ImageDataGenerator to promote generalization and avoid overfitting problem .
